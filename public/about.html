<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a seasoned professional with six years of experience in the manufacturing industry,
  specializing in automation controls and process engineering. Over the course of my career, 
  I have honed my skills and knowledge to become a valuable asset in driving 
  operational excellence and optimizing manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>For the first five years of my career, I worked as an automation controls technician,
  where I gained hands-on experience in maintaining and troubleshooting automated systems. 
  This role allowed me to develop a deep understanding of industrial control systems and their 
  integration with manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>In my most recent position at Tesla, I have been working as a process engineer in the cell manufacturing 
  department. As the process owner for the Electrolyte fill process, I have taken on a pivotal role in supporting 
  the company's ambitious goal of ramping up production for the Tesla 4680 cell. This cutting-edge technology will 
  play a vital role in enabling the successful launch of the highly anticipated Cybertruck and Model Y.</p>

<p>One of my key strengths lies in my strong analytical skill set, which I utilize to support process and quality optimization. 
  I am proficient in programs such as SQL, Python, Tableau, JMP, and Minitab, enabling me to analyze complex data sets and identify 
  areas for improvement. Through data-driven insights, I have successfully implemented process enhancements, resulting in increased 
  efficiency and reduced costs.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have recognized the growing importance of web development in today's digital landscape. To broaden my skill set, 
    I have been actively developing my proficiency in programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a specific focus 
    on web development. This allows me to contribute to projects that involve creating user-friendly interfaces, interactive dashboards,
    and data visualization tools.</p>

<p>Overall, I bring a comprehensive blend of technical expertise, hands-on experience, and a passion for innovation to my work. 
      I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments where I can leverage my analytical mindset and problem-solving abilities to drive 
      continuous improvement and contribute to the success of cutting-edge projects.</p>
